During the past 5 years, CVA4 has become the dominant pathogen resulting in HFMD in China. However, there are no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs available. Houttuynia cordata Thunb (HC). is a Chinese herbal medicine eaten as vegetables for treating viral infection diseases, but whether HC has anti-CVA4 effect remains unclear.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="AIM OF THE STUDY" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">In this study, we want to investigate the antiviral activity of HC against CVA4 in vitro and in vivo and elucidate the potential mechanism of HC against CVA4.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">MTT assay were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of HC. Virus titers assay, CPE assay, violet staining and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the antiviral effect of HC against CVA4. A 13-day-old suckling mice model was established to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HC against CVA4 infection. Western blot, qRT-PCR and time-of-drug addition assay were performed to elucidate the potential mechanism of HC against CVA4 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">MTT assay indicated the cytotoxicity concentration of HC on Vero cells and RD cells were more than 1mg/ml, suggesting that the low cytotoxicity of HC. In vitro antiviral assay revealed that HC could dose-dependently prevent the CPE, suppress the release of newborn virus, and inhibit the replication of CVA4 by decreasing viral RNA transcription and protein expression with IC50 of 88.96 μg/mL. A time-of-addition assay showed that HC mainly exerted anti-CVA4 effect by inhibiting virus replication at the post-entry stage. In vivo results further demonstrated that HC could effectively prevent the lethal infection of CVA4 by promoting survival, improving clinical symptoms, prolonging the survival time, inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses, and reducing pathological injury in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK pathway over-activation may be the primary mechanism of HC against CVA4 infection.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">In summary, our results for the first time demonstrated that HC not only effectively inhibited CVA4 replication, but also partially protected the lethal infection of CVA4 in vivo. Furthermore, pharmacological mechanism studies revealed that the primary mechanism of HC against CVA4 infection may be associated with its effect of inhibiting over-activation of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways caused by enteroviruses. Our finding indicated that HC might be a potential innovative medicine for treating HFMD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2024.
