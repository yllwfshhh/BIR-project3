As a molecular chaperone, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has been shown to play an important role in viral infection. Our results showed that HSP70 can affect translation, replication, assembly, and release during the life cycle of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1). We demonstrated that HSP70 can regulate viral translation by interacting with the DHAV-1 internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In addition, HSP70 interacts with the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP3 and promotes their stability by inhibiting proteasomal degradation, thereby facilitating the assembly of DHAV-1 virions. This study demonstrates the specific role of HSP70 in regulating DHAV-1 replication, which are helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of DHAV-1 infection and provide additional information about the role of HSP70 in infection by different kinds of picornaviruses, as well as the interaction between picornaviruses and host cells.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2024.
